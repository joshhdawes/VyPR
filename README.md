# Prototype of the VyPR Runtime Verification tool

The tool in this repository is for verification of input programs with respect to specifications written in our new logic, Control Flow Temporal Logic.

## Setup

To use VyPR, setup a virtual environment for Python in the directory in which you will run the tool.

Virtual environments are a way to sandbox code, and prevent installing libraries that a single project needs for the entire system.

This can be done by first installing `virtualenv` with `pip`, then running `virtualenv venv`.  This will setup a directory called `venv` in that subdirectory with all necessary Python-related libraries.  You can then run `source ./venv/bin/activate` to initialise the virtual environment.

Once the virtual environment is initialised, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` from inside the tool directory to install the Python dependencies *inside the virtual environment* (if you do this outside of the virtual environment, you will install the dependencies globally).

## Verification

Running `python verification.py -h` will output the following:

```
usage: verification.py [-h] --program PROGRAM [--graph GRAPH]
                       [--optimised-monitor] [--verify] --db DB --property
                       PROPERTY [--check-monitor]

Read in a sample program, instrument it for a property, and run it with
monitoring.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --program PROGRAM    The filename in which the program to instrument and run
                       is found.
  --graph GRAPH        The filename of the graph to output.
  --optimised-monitor  If supplied, use optimised monitor update.
  --verify             If supplied, apply verification.
  --db DB              The database to write the log to - we use this for
                       performance analysis of the monitoring.
  --property PROPERTY  The file in which the property definition is found for
                       verification.
  --check-monitor      If supplied, the monitor size will be tracked.
```

The command line options are as follows:

* `--program` indicates the file name in which the program to be verified is found.
* `--graph` indicates the file name to which the Symbolic Control Flow graph derived from the input program is written.  The format used is graphviz (.gv); when running on my machine, a pdf of the compiled gv file is also generated.
* `--optimised-monitor` tells the verification tool to use an optimisation when changing monitor states during verification.
* `--verify` tells the verification tool to actually verify the program.  Omitting this option will run the input program normally.
* `--db` indicates the database file name to use when storing data about the verification process.  This is normally an SQLite database file which one can setup for use by the verification tool using `CREATE TABLE run ( time_of_run timestamp primary key, run_data text, monitor_data text, optimised_monitor text );` in an SQLite client.
* `--property` indicates the file name in which the Python code specifying the property is found.  See below for documentation about the property specification library.
* `--check-monitor`, if given, tells the verification tool to store information about monitor sizes over time in the run information in `--db`.

## Property Specification

The file specified by the `--property` argument should be a Python file which defines a single variable, `formula_structure`.  Example code is

```
formula_structure = Forall(
		StaticState('q', 'a')
	).Forall(
		StaticTransition('t', 'f', uses='q')
	).Formula(
		lambda q, t: (
			If(
				q('a')._in([0, 80])
			).then(
				t.duration()._in([0, 1])
			)
		)
	)
```

This can be broken down as such:

```
Forall(
		StaticState('q', 'a')
	).Forall(
		StaticTransition('t', 'f', uses='q')
	)
```

defines a sequence of quantifiers to be applied to the property.  In this case, the verification tool will check the property "for every state that changes the program variable `a`, for every transition in the future of each state changing `a` that is a call to the function `f`".

```
Formula(
		lambda q, t: (
			If(
				q('a')._in([0, 80])
			).then(
				t.duration()._in([0, 1])
			)
		)
	)
```

defines a formula, over which the preceding quantification sequence (defined above) is applied.  In this case, the property says that "If `a` is changed to be in the interval [0, 80], then every time the function `f` is called in the future, it should return in time in the interval [0, 1]".

## Verdict Reports

Given a property, the purpose of verifying a property with respect to it is to see both where the property holds *and* where it doesn't.  VyPR currently gives verdict reports - for group of statements in the program (a *group* here is a *static binding*), the set of verdicts associated with that group at runtime is listed at the end of the program run.

```
Binding
[
state change resulting from assignment to a : line 9
edge corresponding to call to f : line 12
]
gave verdicts True, True, True
```

This output says that a binding consisting of two lines, 9 and 12, results in three instances of the property above being checked; they all evaluate to true.
